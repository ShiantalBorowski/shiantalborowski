# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I build custom WordPress sites and work on content management for businesses and organizations.

## About Me

Iâ€™m Shiantal Borowski, a Web Developer with nearly a decade of experience building websites that are both visually appealing and easy to use. Iâ€™m a bit on the quiet side, but Iâ€™m also diligent and add creativity to everything I doâ€”whether itâ€™s coding or art. When Iâ€™m not busy building websites, Iâ€™m probably helping out with animal rescue or finding new ways to get creative. I genuinely enjoy solving problems and diving into whatever sparks my curiosity.
